## Locally test the hook

You can locally test the hook in a project by using an absolute path to the
repository of the hook.

```yaml
repos:
    - repo: /absolute/path/to/the/hook/repository
      rev: "" # Leave this empty to use the last commit
      hooks:
          - id: check
            additional_dependencies: ["@biomejs/biome@latest"]
```

Note that your changes in the hook repository must be committed in order to test
them.
